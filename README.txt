Direction:
In the github project, all the filest needed to run the analysis are in the datadirectory.

If you wish to obtain the data again, run each .py file, and the .csv will be saved in the data directory.

For some of the .py files, an image will be saved in the graphs directory.  The graph directory contains 
a directoryh for forest management (fm) and frozenlake (fl).  

If you just wish to obainm the graphs for analysis.  Open the notebooks an run them.
